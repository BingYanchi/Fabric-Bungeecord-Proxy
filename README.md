# FabricProxy
Fabric mod for support Bungeecord forward player data from proxy

**A Long-Time Support version of [OKTW-FabricProxy].**

Because of many BungeeCord function is not compatible with Fabric-API and most mods, this mod will only fit for newer version at future, and won't add more function for proxy.

This mod only fit for Bungeecord, if you are using Velocity, you can see: [FabricProxy-Lite].

This mod still work but may always have some simple functions, if you want to support it, pull request will be accepted.
